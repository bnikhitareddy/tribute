         <p><u>Mother Earth,</u> the land which gives us everything we need for our survival, provides space for the plants, animals, fish, water, birds, trees, rocks, soil, insects, and human beings. Human beings have determined that they are at the top of the pyramid of life and that everything on Mother Earth is there for them, but humans have also decided they do not have to do anything for those other beings. <br> Mother Earth provides the plants, animals, birds, and fish who give their lives to feed and clothe human beings, while the trees, plants, and soil provide us with shelter, warmth, and a way to grow some of our foods. The insects ensure that our plants are pollinated and assist with their growth. Water, a vital part of all life on Mother Earth, has been abundant and fresh for centuries for all beings in need of the life-giving substance.</p>

         <p>However, as human beings have become “civilized” in a capitalist world, they see all in creation as commodities—including other human beings! Without human beings, plants, animals, fish, water, birds, trees, rocks, soil, and insects would survive. However, if any of our natural relations were not on Mother Earth, we would not survive as we need each and every one of them. We are dependent on them for our life, and yet all in creation do not need us at all. This delicate situation is acutely manifesting itself as researchers, journalists, and some politicians start to sound the alarm on the climate crisis and environmental degradation.</p>

         <p2>Mother Earth needs human beings to help and to stop taking more than we need for the sake of making money and gaining privilege in an unequal system. This past year, the global pandemic has shown that when human beings are not out and about all over the globe, our relations—the plants, animals, trees, fish, birds, insects, and water—start to return to their balance. This is the story the land, Mother Earth, has been trying to tell us for decades. Human beings must balance themselves in their physical, emotional, spiritual, mental, and social aspects as individuals, in relation to their families, their communities, and Nations. Humans move toward this balance through awareness of their interdependence and interconnectedness with all in creation as a synergistic relationship that ebbs and flows day in and day out. Mother Earth, Father Sky, Grandfather Sun, and Grandmother Moon keep us moving forward with the air and light that we cherish and feel as a blessing. Seasonally, Mother Earth cleanses with a blanket of white snow in the northern parts of the globe and rains in the southern parts.</p2>
